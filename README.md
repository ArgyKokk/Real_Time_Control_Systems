# Real_Time_Control_Systems
Assignments part of the course RTSD , UTwente ,2019 <br>
The tools TERRA , LUNA and 20sim were used for those assignments.

## Exercise 1
The first exercise was about creating a producer-consumer system consisting of different processes and testing the deadlocks and the behavior of that system under different circumstances.
## Exercise 2
The second exercise was about taking timing measurements of the producer-consumer system and calculating the jitter. The next part was to create a model of a closed-loop control system and perform timing simulations.
## Exercise 3
The third exercise was to expand the control system from exercise 2 in order to control a robot's motion using a joystick. The design was deployed on a RTOS and timing simulations were performed.
